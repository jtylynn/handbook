# At-Will Employment Policy

Your employment with the SOE is at will. This means that you are free to terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause and the company has a right to terminate your employment at any time as well, with or without cause. No one in the company other than POPS or the CEO have the authority to alter your at-will status or to enter into any agreement for employment for a specified period of time or to make any agreement contrary to this policy. Only POPS or the CEO may do so, and only in a written agreement signed by both parties.
