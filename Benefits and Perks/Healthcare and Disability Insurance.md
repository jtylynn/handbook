# Healthcare and Disability Insurance

SOE’s priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so it’s important that we offer our employees great medical coverage and disability insurance.

We offer medical, dental, and vision coverage at SOE for employees. Through Gusto, many plans are available to all employees, and SOE has chosen baseline plans for which it contributes 100% of the cost for all employees. The available plans range in cost, and if employees choose a plan that is more expensive than the baseline plan, they will be responsible for the difference. All employees are eligible for coverage on the first of the month 30 days following their hire date. These policies are all managed through Gusto, which is where you can find more details about the plans, costs, and coverage.
